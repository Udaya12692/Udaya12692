Anyone is thinking to start new Hotel business can opt to city hotel over to resort hotel as they get more cutomers
As Most customers prefer Bread & Breakfast (BB) meal , Hotels can give some attractive deal on upon choosing this BB type meal which will hepl to attract more customers
August is the busiest month followed by july interms of number of visitors in this case hotel owner can make his team ready to give optimum service to customer and can also encash this high demand of hotel rooms to make more profit Hotel owners can give exlusive offers at low demand time to atract more number of customers to ensure his business to run steadily

We saw more number of bookings are done by using distrubution chanel TA/TO where Hotel has to share its revenue in terms of comisssion The hotel management can offer discounts, complimentary services and offers on direct bookings as the hotel doesnâ€™t pay commissions to third parties and maintains a direct relationship with the customer when a customer books the hotel directly
Most preferred stay in hotels is 3 days, hotel management should introduce loyalty service, offers, tourism package in order to increase the stay of customers and to generate more revenue
